--------========== KANBAN CONSOLE KATA

1. Intro

This project is a .NET Core console app for demonstrating basic programming techniques by building a Kanban board app.
This project does not have any dependencies outside of the framework (System).

This Kata has been tested on Windows 10 using Visual Studio 2019. We expect it will work on other OS platforms and technologies due to the portability of .NET Core.

2. Instructions

Your goal is to make the 7 tests pass without modifying the tests unless the test instructs you to do so. They are located in the "Tests" folder and are prefixed with an underscore.

All tests are ran in order (see Program.cs).

You should be able to use debugging techniques to identify required code changes to make the tests pass. This may include adding missing features or fixing bugs in existing code.

We'd estimate the task will take around an hour and a half to complete, try your best and don't worry if you're unable to complete it within this time, let us know how you get on.

The tests do get more complicated as you proceed through them.

Best of luck!
